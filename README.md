# Dark Neon Theme
> for your favorite text editor:

`This theme is targeted toward front-end developers... sort of`

The Dark Neon Theme is your typical [Textmate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) theme that works with [Sublime Text 2 and 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Choclat](https://chocolatapp.com/). There is also a version for [Coda 2](https://panic.com/coda/) *(for those who like IDEs)* and [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) *(for those who like to write Markdown)*  
The theme is based on [Todd Werth's IR_Black:](http://toddwerth.com/2007/03/29/ir_black-the-last-textmate-theme-youll-ever-need/).

I'm using [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with a custom theme I made called [RDM2](https://github.com/RainyDayMedia/oh-my-zsh-rdm-theme), that is *Git Aware* and displays your current version of ruby with RVM. Feel free to download it user it as is or modify.
